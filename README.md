### Keep your compile time during MOnoMOrphization

This is a `proc_macro` crate to help keeping the code footprint of
generic methods in check. Often, generics are used in libraries to
improve ergonomics.  However,  this has a cost in compile time and
binary size.  Optimally,  one creates a  small shell function that
does the generic conversions and then calls an inner function, but
that makes the code less readable.

Add a `#[momo]`  annotation from this crate to split your function
into an outer conversion and a private inner function.  In return,
you get some compile time for a tiny bit of runtime  (if at all) â€“
without impairing readability.

For now, the only place where we can put the `#[momo]` annotations
is on plain functions.
